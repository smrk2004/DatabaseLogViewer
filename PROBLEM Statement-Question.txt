--Use the AdventureWorks2014 database

PROBLEM Statement

1. Create a web page that sits on the dbo.DatabaseLog table with the following features:

-Need to display column headers and/or field labels that tell me what the data represents.

-A mechanism that allows me to control the number of rows to display.

-Paging mechanism that allow me to page forward and backward.

-A sorting mechanism that allows me to control the order of the data.

 

*NOTE:

1. When the page loads for the first time, the default number of rows to display should be 15.

2. You are free to implement whatever data access layer you deem necessary to solve this problem.
